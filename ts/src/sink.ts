// The push boundary between stages.
//
// A pipeline is a chain of sinks. The source calls the first sink once per
// event, synchronously, inside the parse; each stage does its work and
// calls the next. Nothing is queued between stages, so a slow writer at the
// end slows the parser at the start: that is the backpressure, and it
// costs no buffer. A stage that must stop early (a `take`) answers
// `'stop'`, which the source turns into a cancelled parse. A stage that
// fails throws a `Fail`; the source stops the parse and the failure
// reaches the caller unchanged.
