//! Limits, metrics and cancellation.
//!
//! Limits are part of a plan, not advice: a stage that would exceed one
//! fails with [`Code::ResourceLimitExceeded`](crate::Code) naming the
//! field, rather than switching to a slower or larger algorithm. Values
//! are payload bytes (UTF-8 lengths of keys and scalars, and the sum of
//! them for a retained value plus a fixed per-node allowance), which is a
//! stable and portable measure; they are not a heap measurement.
